In this section you will learn about dependent features mechanism for ordering your features execution.

#### Dependent features mechanism explanation

Dependent Features can be used if you need to pass some context data but between feature files. It's also applicable when you have to execute feature files in sequence one after another (e.g. E2E scenarios).

The framework forms chains from dependent features and these chains are being executed inside one thread in an order that you have set.

> **_NOTE:_** The BDD Jest Framework sends reports to Ureport Portal using API calls. It can utilize few threads and create the same count of `launches` in UReport. In order to see reports in one `launch` you should run test automation in one thread, in other words, using testOrder.config.json or Dependent features. 

#### testOrder.config file

To use that feature you will need `testOrder.config.json`, it will be autogenerated during init, if you approve according option. Let's look into some examples:
You have the following features folder structure:

```
features/
  1/
    1.1.feature
    1.2.feature
  2/
    2.1.feature
    2.2.feature
    2.2.feature
```

Accordingly feature files have tags:

```gherkin
@all
@1
@1.1
Feature: 1.1
```

```gherkin
@all
@1
@1.2
Feature: 1.2
```

```gherkin
@all
@2
@2.1
Feature: 2.1
```

```gherkin
@all
@2
@2.2
Feature: 2.2
```

```gherkin
@all
@2
@2.3
Feature: 2.3
```

Then we can create chains of dependent features in `testOrder.config.json` as following:

```json
"@1": ["@1.1", "@1.2"],
"@2": ["@2.3", "@2.2", "@2.1"]
"@all": ["@1.1", "@1.2", "@2.3", "@2.2", "@2.1"]
```

#### Usage in launch script

 You can set up a path to the testOrder.config.json file in CLI. The appropriate parameter `--testOrderPath` accepts relative path like './dist/_test_specs/scr/testOrder.config.json'
